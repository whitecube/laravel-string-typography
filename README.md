# Typography Rules for Laravel

Rendering strings provided by users can result in unexpected typographic results. For instance, in most latin languages (such as french) it is recommended to add a non-breakable space in front of, amongst others, exclamation or question marks (`!` and `?`). Most users will probably just type a regular space, which could result in an unwanted line break just before these punctuation marks.

This simple package provides a `typography` macro for Laravel's `Str` facade and `Stringable` instances (created using `Str::of()` or `str()`) that will take care of these typographic details.

It is also possible to enhance this package by adding your own typographic rules.

```php
$content = 'Mama mia !';

echo str($content)->typography();
```
```
Mama mia&nbsp;!
```

## Installation

```bash
composer require whitecube/laravel-string-typography
```

## Getting started

The package's ServiceProvider and therefore its `typography` macro will automatically be registered upon installation. You can start using it right away:

```blade
{{-- Using the "Str" facade --}}
<h1>{!! Str::typography($title) !!}</h1>

{{-- Using the "str()" helper --}}
<p>{!! str($paragraph)->typography() !!}</p>
```

Using `Stringable` instances, you can chain `typography` with other helper methods:

```blade
<div>{!! str($text)->markdown()->typography() !!}</div>
```

> [!NOTE]  
> Since the transformed strings contain HTML entities (such as `&nbsp;`), don't forget to render them using `{!! !!}` instead of `{{ }}` in your Blade templates.

## Default typographic rules

| Key                       | Usage                                               | Description                                                                                   |
|:------------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `unbreakable-punctuation` | Remove unwanted line breaks in front of punctuation | Replaces ` !`, ` ?`, ` :`, ` ;` with `&nbsp;!`, `&nbsp;?`, `&nbsp;:`, `&nbsp;;` respectively. |
| `hellip`                  | Use the correct "horizontal ellipsis" HTML entity   | Replaces `&#8230;`, `&#x2026;`, `...`, `‚Ä¶` with `&hellip;`.                                   |

## Registering & removing typographic rules

```php
use Whitecube\Strings\Typography;

Typography::rule(
    key: 'a-to-b',
    regex: '/a/',
    callback: fn(array $matches) => 'b',
);
```

By default all the previously registered typographic rules will be applied when using the new `typography` method. It is possible to globally remove one of them using:

```php
use Whitecube\Strings\Typography;

Typography::remove('a-to-b');
```

## Filtering typographic rules

Call a single or a few specific rules:

```blade
<div>{!! str($text)->typography(only: 'hellip') !!}</div>
<div>{!! str($text)->typography(only: ['hellip', 'unbreakable-punctuation']) !!}</div>
```

Call all rules except a single or a few specific unwanted rules:

```blade
<div>{!! str($text)->typography(except: 'hellip') !!}</div>
<div>{!! str($text)->typography(except: ['hellip', 'unbreakable-punctuation']) !!}</div>
```
